                        <div class="white-belt">
                    <h2>white</h2>
                        <p class="desc">White belt is probably the most frustrating stage of Brazilian
                    jiu-jitsu training. For one thing, when you start off as a brand new
                    white belt, everyone in the gym is better than you, and it shows
                    every time you roll. For about the first six months, you’re going to
                    be tapping – a lot. And, this can be extremely hard for some people,
                    especially if you’re the type of person who is very competitive.</p>
                    <h3>0-1 year</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blue-belt">
                    <h2>blue</h2>
                        <p class="desc">By the time you reach blue belt, you should have a firm grasp of the
                            basics of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Yet, at this point you really haven’t
                            developed a game; instead you’re still learning the fundamentals.
                            And actually, blue belt is the stage where you transition from
                            merely learning techniques to applying them in combinations. It’s
                            also the stage where you’ll start developing your strategy, based on
                            your own personal strengths, weaknesses, body type, physical
                            capabilities, and personality. In other words, blue belt is when
                            your game starts to emerge. </p>
                            <h3>2-4 years</h3>

                    <h2>purple</h2>
                        <p class="desc">The interesting thing about purple belt is that it takes about the
                    same about of time and effort to get a purple belt in jiu-jitsu as
                    it does to get a black belt in most other martial arts. By the time
                    you reach purple belt, chances are good that you’ll have learned
                    almost all the techniques in your school’s curriculum up to black
                    belt. So, at this point it’s all about developing the sort of smooth
                    transitions, combinations, and set-ups that separate a new purple
                    belt from the seasoned faixa roxa who can dominate every blue belt
                    in the school. </p>

                    <h2>brown</h2>
                        <p class="desc"> At brown belt the student is almost a black belt. They are capable
                    of using a wider variety of techniques in sparring than the lower
                    ranks, purple belt included. And, they are expected to have a much
                    deeper knowledge of the art at this stage as well. For the student
                    who has reached brown belt, their goal in training is to learn all
                    those subtleties that make the difference between merely adequate
                    technique, and techniques that are optimally effective. It is a
                    stage of refinement of skill, rather than the development of skill
                    or the learning of new skills. And in reality, what the student is
                    doing at brown belt is preparing to be a good black belt.</p>

                        <p class="desc">Black belt is really the rank where you’ve smoothed out all the
                    rough edges in your technique. But not only that, a good black belt
                    understands the why behind the technique, and they can teach those
                    little nuances that make the difference between a merely good
                    technique, and an expert technique. A good black belt can show you
                    the subtleties that mean the difference between skill and mastery.</p>
